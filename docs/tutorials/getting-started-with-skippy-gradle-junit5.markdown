## Setting Up Your Environment

Begin by cloning the skippy-docs repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:skippy-io/skippy-tutorials.git
```

Then, move into the tutorial directory:
```
cd skippy-tutorials/getting-started-with-skippy-and-junit5/
```

Ensure that the project builds successfully:
```````
./gradlew check
```````

A successful build will display:
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

## Exploring the Codebase

Let's take a quick look at the codebase.

### The build.gradle File

`build.gradle` applies the `io.skippy` plugin and adds a dependency to `skippy-junit5`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'io.skippy' version '{% include_relative version.markdown %}'
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'io.skippy:skippy-junit5:{% include_relative version.markdown %}'
}
```

The plugin adds a couple of tasks that we will use throughout the tutorial:
```
./gradlew tasks --group=skippy
```
Output:

```
Skippy tasks
------------
skippyAnalyze
skippyClean
```

Note: You can play around with those tasks. If you do so, execute `skippyClean` before proceeding with the
rest of the tutorial:
```
./gradlew skippyClean
```
