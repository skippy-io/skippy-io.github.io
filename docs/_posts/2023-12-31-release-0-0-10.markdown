I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.10 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.10](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.10)

## Highlights

This release contains smaller bug fixes that add support for
[Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)'s build. Support for Spring Boot's massive multi-module
build marks another milestone from proof-of-concept to practical solution for complex real-world builds.

## Other noteworthy changes

Skippy now creates two new files in the skippy folder:
- `decisions.log`
- `profiling.log`

`decisions.log` contains information about skip-or-execute decisions for each skippified test. This is useful for
- Skippy's functional tests,
- documentation and
- troubleshooting purposes.

Example `decisions.log`:
```
com.example.LeftPadderTest:EXECUTE:BYTECODE_CHANGE_IN_TEST
com.example.RightPadderTest:EXECUTE:BYTECODE_CHANGE_IN_TEST
```

`profiling.log` contains profiling information to analyze Skippy's performance.
