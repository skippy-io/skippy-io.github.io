I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.8 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.8](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.8)

## Highlights

This version introduces the `skippy-junit4` module:

```groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'io.skippy:skippy-junit4:0.0.8'
}    
```

It provides a `TestRule` to skippify JUnit 4 tests:

```java
import io.skippy.junit4.Skippy;
...

public class FooTest {

    @ClassRule
    public static TestRule skippyRule = Skippy.skippify();

    @Test
    public void testFoo() {
        ...
    }

}
```

## Other noteworthy changes 

A failed execution of `skippyAnalyze` will now clear the skippy folder.
