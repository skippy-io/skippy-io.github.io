I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.16 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.16](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.16)

## Highlights

This release gets rid of the term "skippified":
- Renaming of `io.skippy.junit5.Skippified` to `io.skippy.junit5.PredictWithSkippy`
- Renaming of `io.skippy.junit4.Skippy.skippified()` to `io.skippy.junit4.Skippy.predictWithSkippy()`
