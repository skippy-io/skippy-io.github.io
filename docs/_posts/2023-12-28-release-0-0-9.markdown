I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.9 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.9](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.9)

## Highlights

This version introduces Maven support for Skippy: [Getting Started with Skippy, Maven & JUnit 5](../tutorials/skippy-maven-junit5)

Maven support comes in the form of the `skippy-maven` plugin:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.skippy</groupId>
    <artifactId>skippy-maven</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.9</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <goals>
          <goal>analyze</goal>
          <goal>clean</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

The environment variable `skippyAnalyze` enables the Skippy analysis during test execution:
```
mvn test -DskippyAnalyze=true 
```

The `clean` goal clears the skippy folder:
```
mvn skippy:clean
```
