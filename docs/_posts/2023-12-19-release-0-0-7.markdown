I'm please to announce that Skippy 0.0.7 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

# Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.7](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.7)

# Highlights

Earlier versions generated coverage data by initiating a separate build for each skippified test,
utilizing [Gradle’s Tooling API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/third_party_integration.html#embedding).
This method significantly slowed down `skippyAnalyze`, making it much slower than Gradle’s `check` task.

Skippy has undergone a complete overhaul in this release. The latest version efficiently generates per-test coverage 
data for all tests, achieving this with minimal overhead compared to `check`. This improvement is thanks to a new approach
that utilizes JUnit 5 extensions to capture per-test coverage.

The overhaul, which moves responsibilities from the Gradle plugin into the core Java libraries, paves the way to add
Maven support in the future. It also marks a significant milestone in Skippy’s evolution from  proof-of-concept into
practical solution to the challenges faced by developers in complex build environments.
