I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.17 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.17](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.17)

## Highlights

This release adds support for incremental updates of the Skippy folder for Gradle-based builds in cases where the build fails due to a failing test case.

Old behavior:

```
./gradlew test

FooTest > testFoo() PASSED   ─┐
BarTest > testBar() FAILED    │
                              │ a tests that previously passed
./gradlew test                │ is executed again in a subsequent build
                              │
FooTest > testFoo() PASSED   ←┘  
BarTest > testBar() FAILED   
```

New behavior:

```
./gradlew test

FooTest > testFoo() PASSED   ─┐
BarTest > testBar() FAILED    │
                              │ a tests that previously passed
./gradlew test                │ is skipped in a subsequent build
                              │
FooTest > testFoo() SKIPPED  ←┘  
BarTest > testBar() FAILED  
```
