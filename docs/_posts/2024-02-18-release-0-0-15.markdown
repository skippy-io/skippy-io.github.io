I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.15 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.15](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.15)

## Highlights

### Highlights

- Users no longer have to invoke `./gradlew skippyAnalzye`  or `mvn skippy:analyze`: Skippy automatically runs when tests are executed
- Skippy incrementally updates the data in the .skippy folder when it detects a change
- The .cov & classes.md5 files have been replaced with a single JSON file
