I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.18 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.18](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.18)

## Highlights

This release introduces support for generating coverage reports that include coverage for skipped tests. This feature is particularly useful for corporate CI pipelines with strict code coverage requirements.

### Gradle Configuration

To enable this feature in Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
skippy {
    saveExecutionData = true
}
```

### Maven Configuration

To enable this feature in Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```
<plugin>
        <groupId>io.skippy</groupId>
        <artifactId>skippy-maven</artifactId>
        ...
        <configuration>
          <saveExecutionData>true</saveExecutionData>
        </configuration>
        ...   
</plugin>
```

### skippy.exec

Skippy will automatically generate a JaCoCo execution data file named skippy.exec if the feature is enabled and there is at least a single skipped test. This file is placed within the build directory, typically found under build/ for Gradle projects or target/ for Maven projects.

skippy.exec aggregates the execution data for all skipped tests. It can be merged with JaCoCo's standard execution data file to generate a combined report that contains coverage for executed and skipped tests:
