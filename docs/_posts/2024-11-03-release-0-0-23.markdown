I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.23 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.


## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.23](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.23)

## Highlights

This release introduces the [Opt-Out Mechanism](https://www.skippy.io/docs/#opt-out-mechanism) to bypass Skippy's
skip-or-execute logic for tests annotated with `@AlwaysRun`:

```java
@PredictWithSkippy
public class NestedTestsTest {

    @Nested
    class FooTest {
        
        @Test
        void testSomething() {
            // this test can be skipped by Skippy
        }
        
    }

    @AlwaysRun
    @Nested
    class BarTest {
        
        @Test
        void testSomething() {
            // this test will always run
        }
        
    }

}
```
