I'm pleased to announce that Skippy 0.0.12 has been released and is now available in Gradle's Plugin Portal and Maven
Central.

## Release Notes

[https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.12](https://github.com/skippy-io/skippy/releases/tag/v0.0.12)

## Highlights

This release fixes an issue in `skippy-junit5` that caused 3rd party extensions to be evaluated even though Skippy already made a skip prediction. This **significantly** speeds up the execution of skippable tests in projects that make use
- `@ExtendsWith(SpringExtension.class)`,
- `@Testcontainers` and
- other extensions that perform time consuming setup work.
