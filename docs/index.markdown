Skippy is designed for the modern pace of software development, where Continuous Integration (CI) should be a boon, not 
a burden. Unlike traditional CI tools that run all tests regardless of necessity, Skippy's intelligent test impact 
analysis cuts down on unnecessary testing and flakiness, slashing build times to improve developer productivity and 
happiness.

Harnessing both dynamic and static bytecode analysis, Skippy lets you iterate faster without compromising the integrity
of your builds. It’s about working smarter, not harder—let Skippy streamline your builds, so you can get back to what CI
was meant to be: a fast track to production.
