Skippy is designed for the modern pace of software development, where Continuous Integration (CI) should be a boon, not
a burden. Unlike traditional CI tools that run all tests regardless of necessity, Skippy's intelligent test impact
analysis cuts down on unnecessary testing
and flakiness, slashing build times to improve developer productivity and happiness.

It’s about working smarter, not harder—let Skippy streamline your builds, so you can get back to what CI was meant to
be: a fast track to production. Built upon robust frameworks like [Gradle](https://gradle.org), [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) and [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/), Skippy lets you deliver quality code
faster without compromising the integrity of your builds.
